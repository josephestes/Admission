# Admission

This program outputs "admission" results based on user input.

### Program Logic:

- Allow the user to enter a numeric grade point average (for example, 3.2) and an test score (for example, 75)
- Display the message "Accept" if the student meets either of the following requirements:
  1. A grade point average of 3.0 or higher, and an admission test score of at least 60
  2. A grade point average of less than 3.0, and an admission test score of at least 80
- If the student does not meet either of the qualification criteria, display "Reject"
