# Admission

In this scenario I wrote a program for a college's admissions office with the following criteria:

  The user can enter a numeric high school grade point average (for example, 3.2) and an admission test score (for example, 75). 

  The program must display the message "Accept" if the student meets either of the following requirements:
  1. A grade point average of 3.0 or higher, and an admission test score of at least 60
  2. A grade point average of less than 3.0, and an admission test score of at least 80
  3. If the student does not meet either of the qualification criteria, display "Reject".
